She was, apart from our current Queen, the oldest ever British monarch, living to the age of 81. And she was also the youngest ever British (as opposed to English or Scottish) monarch, coming to the throne as a girl of eighteen. And yet whenever television or the cinema make a programme or film about her, they seem far more interested in the older Victoria than they do in the young girl; the version of Victoria with which modern audiences will probably be most familiar is Judi Dench in \"Mrs Brown\". \"The Young Victoria\" tries to redress the balance by showing us the events surrounding her accession and the early years of her reign. It has the rare distinction of being produced by a former Royal, Sarah Duchess of York, whose daughter Princess Beatrice makes a brief appearance as an extra.<br/><br/>There are three main strands to the plot. The first concerns the intrigues of Victoria\\'s mother, the Duchess of Kent, a highly unpopular figure even with her own daughter, largely because of the influence of her adviser Sir John Conroy, who was widely rumoured to be her lover. (According to one unfounded rumour he, and not the late Duke of Kent, was Victoria\\'s natural father). The second strand concerns the growing romance between Victoria and her German cousin Prince Albert, and the attempts of King Leopold of Belgium, who was uncle to both of them, to influence this romance. (Leopold\\'s hope was to increase the prestige of the House of Saxe-Coburg, to which both he and Albert belonged). The third concerns one of the strangest episodes in British political history, the Bedchamber Crisis of 1839, when supporters of the Tory Party (which had traditionally supported a strong monarchy) rioted because the young Queen was perceived to favour the Whig Party and their leader Lord Melbourne, even though the Whigs had historically supported a quasi-republican system of government, with the monarch reduced to a figurehead.<br/><br/>Scriptwriter Julian Fellowes is known for his Conservative views, and at times I wondered if this may have coloured his treatment of political themes, as he seems to lean to the side of the Tories, the predecessors of the modern Conservative party. Their leader Robert Peel is shown as statesmanlike and dignified, whereas Melbourne, for all his dash and charm, is shown as devious and uninterested in social reform. There may be some truth is these characterisations, but Fellowes glosses over the fact that only a few years earlier the Tories had opposed the Reform Act, which ended the corrupt electoral system of rotten boroughs, and that they had benefited from William IV\\'s unconstitutional dismissal of a Whig administration.<br/><br/>Lessons in dynastic and constitutional history do not always transfer well to the cinema screen, and this one contains its share of inaccuracies. Prince Albert, for example, was not injured in Edward Oxford\\'s attempt on Victoria\\'s life, and Melbourne (in his late fifties at the time of Victoria\\'s accession) was not as youthful as he is portrayed here by Paul Bettany. King William IV certainly disliked the Duchess of Kent (who was his sister-in-law), but I doubt if he would have gone so far as to bawl abuse at her during a state banquet, as he is shown doing here. I also failed to understand the significance of the scene in which the Duchess and Conroy try to force Victoria to sign a \"Regency Order\"; the Duchess\\'s constitutional position was made clear by the Regency Act 1830, which provided that she would become Regent if her daughter was still under eighteen at the time of her accession. No piece of paper signed by Victoria could have altered the provisions of the Act.<br/><br/>There are also occasional infelicities. In one early scene we see Victoria and Albert playing chess while comparing themselves to pawns being moved around a chessboard, a metaphor so hackneyed that the whole scene should have come complete with a \"Danger! Major cliché ahead!\" warning. Yet in spite of scenes like this, I came to enjoy the film. There were some good performances, especially from Miranda Richardson as the scheming Duchess and Mark Strong as the obnoxious Conroy. It is visually very attractive, being shot in sumptuous style we have come to associate with British historical drama. Jim Broadbent gives an amusing turn as King William, although he does occasionally succumb to the temptation of going over the top. (Although not as disastrously over the top as he was in \"Moulin Rouge\").<br/><br/>The main reason for the film\\'s success, however, is the performances of Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend as the two young lovers Victoria and Albert. Blunt is probably more attractive than Victoria was in real life, but in her delightful portrayal the Queen is no longer the old lady of the popular imagination, the black-clad Widow of Windsor who was perpetually not amused, but a determined, strong-minded and loving young woman. Her love for Albert, and their happy family life together, was one of the main reasons why the monarchy succeeded in reestablishing itself in the affections of the British people. (With the exception of George III, Victoria\\'s Hanoverian ancestors had been notoriously lacking in the matrimonial virtues). Blunt and Friend make \"The Young Victoria\" a touching romance and a gripping human drama as well as an exploration of a key period in British history. 8/10'}, {'username': 'graham-167', 'rating': 'Null', 'helpful': '116', 'total': '141', 'date': '10 March 2009', 'title': ' Better than I expected\\n', 'review': \"I went into this expecting not to like it; I figured it would be terribly worthy and earnest, and rather plodding and dull.<br/><br/>It's actually far better than that, and I found myself really enjoying it. I don't know too much about Queen Victoria beyond what most know - married to Albert, who died young, and she mourned him ever after. Seeing the circumstances she grew up under was fascinating; in fact I found myself wishing I'd seen more of the story, and I imagine we may see a sequel at some point.<br/><br/>Visually the film is stunning. The sets and costumes are incredibly lavish without being too gaudy and over the top. The acting is top notch from everybody involved.<br/><br/>In a word, it was great!\"}, {'username': 'inkblot11', 'rating': '8', 'helpful': '34', 'total': '39', 'date': '27 January 2010', 'title': ' To be Blunt, haha, Emily B does beautiful work in this lovely bit of historical drama\\n', 'review': 'Princess Victoria (Emily Blunt) is in line for the throne of England. The present King William (Jim Broadbent) is not well and may not live long. However, Vicky\\'s scheming mother, The Duchess of Kent (Miranda Richandson) and her aide, John (Mark Strong) want to force Victoria to sign papers declaring them to be the \"regents\" until she is older, since she is only 20 years of age. The young lady refuses, despite John slapping her around. It is another sign that Victoria has a strong will and deep love for her country. Yet, when William does pass away, shortly after her 21st birthday, Victoria knows she has a heavy duty before her. First, she must surround herself with the \"right\" advisers to govern wisely. She chooses handsome Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany) who, although an older man, is mentioned as a suitor for Vicky. Which brings us to the young queen\\'s second major decision. Sooner than not, the young queen should select her future mate, as it will bring stability to her life and to those of the kingdom, for an heir must appear in the coming years. Meanwhile, in Germany, some distant relatives of the British royal family are hatching some plans as well. Handsome Prince Albert (Rupert Friend), of the Saxon-Coburg dynasty, is prodded by his father to court the young English royal. Once he arrives at the palace, he is smitten and the feeling seems to be mutual. But, since he is a minor player on the map of royal match-making, can he succeed in winning her heart? This is a lovely film, made even better by a completely winning performance by Emily Blunt as Victoria. Yes, she is beautiful but it is her intelligent reading of the role that scores mightily. Friend, too, does well, as do the other actors, including Broadbent, Richardson, Bettany, Strong (what a repulsive role!), and the rest. Also, the movie is gorgeously shot, costumed, and set, making it a visual treat in every way. If anything is lacking, it is an extra dose of dazzle, as the film seems a bit too straightforward and prosaic, at times, with a somewhat unimaginative edit. However, this is only a minor, minor point of argument in an overall very successful and gorgeous film. In short, young and old, should make time for Young Victoria. It is a most worthy film among 2009 cinematic offerings.'}, {'username': 'evanston_dad', 'rating': '7', 'helpful': '24', 'total': '27', 'date': '11 May 2010', 'title': ' Emily Blunt Shines as Queen Victoria\\n', 'review': 'Sometimes I\\'m glad that my grasp of English history is pathetically feeble. It makes movies like \"The Young Victoria\" much more suspenseful than they might otherwise be. I of course knew that Victoria reigned for a large part of the 19th century and that she died in 1901; I also knew that she was a renowned and powerful monarch. I didn\\'t know much about her love life, and \"The Young Victoria\" filled that gap in my knowledge nicely.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt plays Victoria with a distinctly modern edge of feminism which may feel a bit anachronistic to picky historian purists but which also works. After all, women like Victoria WERE the feminists of their time, forced into making their mark in what was largely a man\\'s world by a man\\'s terms. I\\'m convinced that Blunt is one of the most promising of today\\'s young actors. She has tremendous presence on screen; while she\\'s on it, you don\\'t want to look anywhere else. That presence is somewhat wasted in this movie, because her biggest competition comes not from any other actors but from the period sets and costumes. But she gives this rather light and inconsequential film some substance by virtue of simply being in it.<br/><br/>Rupert Friend plays Albert, the man Victoria eventually marries, while Paul Bettany plays her chief adviser and confidant, the man angling to get himself married to her for his own political gain. The cast of British regulars also includes Jim Broadbent, who gets crazier with every role he plays, Miranda Richardson, as Victoria\\'s doormat of a mother, and, notable in a small role, Harriet Walter as Victoria\\'s widowed aunt and the only person other than her eventual husband who gives her any advice that\\'s worth a damn.<br/><br/>Grade: B+'}, {'username': 'Otoboke', 'rating': 'Null', 'helpful': '80', 'total': '100', 'date': '12 July 2009', 'title': ' Beautiful, memorable but most of all, human.\\n', 'review': 'The 63 year reign of Queen Victoria is perhaps one of the most documented and popularly known historical reigns in British history. On the one hand, her story lacks the theatrics of earlier royals thanks to a change in social climate and attitudes, and on the other her story is one that perpetuates because it is notably human. Taking on the earlier years of her life where the budding romance between herself and the German Prince Albert was taking forefront, director Jean-Marc Vallée who has only until recently remained in the unbeknownst shadows of the industry here takes Victoria\\'s story and captures that human element so vital to her legacy. It\\'s a story that feels extremely humble considering its exuberant background, and yet that\\'s partly what gives it a distinct edge here that separates it from the usual fare.<br/><br/>Taking a very direct and focused approach that centres in on a brief five or so year period between her ascension and marriage to Albert, The Young Victoria does what so little period pieces of this nature offer. Instead of attempting a sprawling encapsulation of such a figure\\'s entire life, Vallée instead opts to show one of the lesser known intricacies of Victoria\\'s early years which are easily overlooked in favour of the more publicly known accolades. The result is a feature that may disgruntle historians thanks to its relatively flippant regards to facts and the like, yet never to let document get in the way of extracting a compelling story, writer Julian Fellowes sticks to his guns and delivers a slightly romanticised yet convincing portrayal. Vallée takes this and runs, making sure to fully capitalise on those elements with enough restraint to maintain integrity in regards to both the history involved and the viewer watching.<br/><br/>A major part in the joy of watching The Young Victoria play out however simply lies in the production values granted here that bring early 1800\\'s Regal Britain to life with a vigorous realism so rarely achieved quite so strikingly by genre films. Everything from the costume designs, sets, hair styles, lighting and photography accentuates the grandiose background inherent to Victoria\\'s story without ever over-encumbering it. Indeed, while watching Vallée\\'s interpretation come to life here it is very hard not to be sucked in solely through the aesthetics that permeates the visual element; and then there\\'s the film\\'s score also which works tremendously to further the very elegant yet personal tones that dominate Fellowes\\' script. Entwining the works of Schubert and Strauss into Victoria and Albert\\'s story not only works as a point of reference for the characters to play with, but also melds to the work with an elegance and refrain that echoes composer Ilan Eshkeri\\'s original work just as well.<br/><br/>Yet for all the poignant compositions, lush backdrops and immaculate costumes that punctuate every scene, the single most important factor here—and indeed to most period dramas—are the performances of the cast and how they help bring the world they exist in to life. Thankfully The Young Victoria is blessed with an equally immaculate ensemble of thespians both young and old that do a fantastic job of doing just that. Between the sweet, budding romance of Victoria (Emily Blunt) and Albert (Rupert Friend) and the somewhat antagonistic struggles of her advisors and the like (spearheaded by a terrific Mark Strong and Paul Bettany), the conflicts and warmth so prevalent to Fellowe\\'s screenplay are conveyed perfectly here by all involved which helps keep the movie from being a plastic \"nice to look at but dim underneath\" affair so common with these outings.<br/><br/>In the end, it\\'s hard to fault a work such as The Young Victoria. It\\'s got a perfectly touching and human sense of affection within its perfectly paced romance, plus some historical significance that plays as an intriguing source of interest for those in the audience keen on such details. Of course, it may not take the cinematic world by storm and there lacks a certain significance to its overall presence that stops it from ever becoming more than just a poignantly restrained romantic period drama; yet in a sense this is what makes it enjoyable. Vallée never seems to be striving for grandeur, nor does he seem content at making a run-of-the-mill escapist piece for aficionados. Somewhere within this gray middle-ground lies The Young Victoria, sure to cater to genre fans and those a little more disillusioned by the usual productions; beautiful, memorable but most of all, human.<br/><br/><ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>'}, {'username': 'cliveevansnp', 'rating': '9', 'helpful': '85', 'total': '108', 'date': '8 March 2009', 'title': ' A warm and moving love story, beautifully acted by Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend\\n', 'review': \"Despite some reviews being distinctly Luke-warm, I found the story totally engrossing and even if some critics have described the love story as 'Mills and Boon', so what? It is good to see a warm, touching story of real love in these cynical times. Many in the audience were sniffing and surreptitiously dabbing their eyes. You really believe that the young Victoria and Albert are passionately fond of each other, even though, for political reasons, it was an arranged marriage. I did feel though that Sir John Conroy, who was desperate to control the young Queen, is perhaps played too like a pantomime villain. As it is rumoured that he was in fact, the real father of Victoria (as a result of an affair with her mother The Duchess of Kent) it would have been interesting to explore this theory. Emily Blunt is totally convincing as the young Princess, trapped in the stifling palace with courtiers and politicians out to manipulate her. She brilliantly portrays the strength of character and determination that eventually made Victoria a great Queen of England, which prospered as never before, under her long reign. I believe word of mouth recommendations will ensure great success for this most enjoyable and wonderful looking movie.\"}, {'username': 'ferguson-6', 'rating': '6', 'helpful': '20', 'total': '24', 'date': '8 February 2010', 'title': ' Victorian Rebel without a Cause, but a Crown\\n', 'review': \"Greetings again from the darkness. Emily Blunt would have stolen The Devil Wears Prada if not for the queen of screen, Meryl Streep.

While the two meet as youngsters, the bond between them comes from their letters ... an early precursor to eHarmony?? We know Victoria mostly from royal portraits, so it's nice to see her as a rebellious youngster trying to learn the tricks of the trade, even while being manipulated like a pawn by her mother (Miranda Richardson) and her lover (Mark Strong). We get to see her tenacity blossom as she matures and literally grows into the monarchy.<br/><br/>While Ms. Blunt's performance is strong, Julian Fellowes' writing is not at the level of his previous work in Gosford Park.

I was the most amazed by the thoughtful cinematography. How every person is placed in relation to the background or foreground is well thought out, every scene is well composed. The scene that strikes me the most was when Victoria talks to Melbourne. Melbourne was positioned in the middle of the door frame from Victoria\\'s angle, while from Melbourne\\'s angle Victoria was situated between the space where Melbourne held his arm on his hips.<br/><br/>Story wise, it is far too compressed to be followed and understood by a person without historical knowledge of Queen Victoria.

More contemporary stories would include Helen Mirren's award winning portrayal of The Queen on the current reign of Queen Elizabeth II at the turn of Princess Diana's death.<br/><br/>Each of the films mentioned featured stunning actresses with acting gravitas (ok, so some may dispute Johansson) or were the flavour of their moment, and each film had a definitive moment in their historical character's legacy that it becomes a no brainer to have those events featured, and in fact Elizabeth had enough to span two films. However, The Young Victoria, as the title already suggests, is a lite-version of the young queen's life, and if you're looking for that definitive event, or the staple political intrigue that plague all royal households and their dealings with shady, self-serving politicians, unfortunately there's nothing of depth here.<br/><br/>That's not to say The Young Victoria is without. Directed by Canadian Jean-Marc Vallee (best known for CRAZY) and written by Julian Fellowes, this film chronicles in very plain terms, ,the life and times of Victoria (Emily Blunt, soon becoming the new It girl) when she was a child, the troubles she faced before Coronation such as the eagerness of her mom The Duchess of Kent (Miranda Richardson) and her adviser Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong) to appoint themselves as joint-Regent to her throne, as already planned for by reigning King William (Jim Broadbent). As if that wasn't enough, the political power play enters the picture with Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany) being a Prime Minister-in-waiting trying to gain the trust of the new Queen, and subtly plants his own trusted allies into positions within the palace. On one hand you'd understand the need for a young, and new Queen to have trusted people in key positions, but on the other, are they really acting in her interests, or in the interests of others?<br/><br/>Even this angle of intrigue creeps into her romantic story with Prince Albert (Rupert Friend), where their relationship forms the bulk of the second half of the film, and pretty much everything already included in the trailers. For both, they've been brought up under the influence of others, and told each step of the way exactly what to do. Even their union may seem like a firm registration of an alliance, if not for both lovers recognizing their common need to establish their own grounding, and to do so with the help of each other. Instead of being pawns, there's this constant search and probing of opportunities to break out of stifling, and at times absurd, rules and regulations. Trust also becomes a much valued commodity, and loyalty too can be traded for wanting to set the slate clean.<br/><br/>However, all these themes become but a breeze through the narrative, from childhood to romance, marriage and children. In fact, there's so much fast-forwarding here, especially the last few minutes filled with inter-titles, that it actually leaves the audience wanting for more, and room of course for another movie, which I suspect would probably not see the light of day, but perhaps a television series might pick up on the film's response, and come out with a mini-series or such. It's a pity that all the effort here in ensuring the gorgeous costumes, sets and art direction would be confined to a film that's quite lightweight in theme and brief mention of issues, that they don't really challenge the protagonists in order to allow for some overcoming of character-defining adversary.<br/><br/>With its star-studded cast, one would expect more, but one would be left wanting more instead. Recommended for those who are ever curious about Kings and Queens in the British Monarchy, only as a complement to other more engaging stories available in the other films already mentioned.\"}, {'username': 'paulo_ljcc', 'rating': '9', 'helpful': '10', 'total': '14', 'date': '13 January 2010', 'title': ' Sparkling Emily Blunt; Very entertaining/teaching picture.\\n', 'review': 'And that\\'s why historic/biographic movies are so important to all of us, moreover when they are so well done, like this one!<br/><br/>Before I saw \"The Young Victoria\", I knew a few things about Queen Victoria, but in the end I got much more knowledge about it. <br/><br/>Emily Blunt is simply GREAT as Victoria (Who would guess that!) and She probably will get a nomination at this years Oscar\\'s.

Thankfully, THE YOUNG VICTORIA avoids this mistake by choosing to focus on the early years of Queen Victoria's reign. The source of dramatic conflict is how, as a young monarch, she was pulled this way and that by advisors and politicians who were all vying for control and influence. Meanwhile, she finds a friend (and eventually, lover) in Prince Albert. One thing the film does really well is show the difficulty inherent in being a leader, especially when one is young and viewed as inexperienced. Emily Blunt pulls off the role admirably and shows the chops she would bring to later performances such as EDGE OF TOMORROW, although her character here is a little more vulnerable. I thought she showed both sides quite well. Rupert Friend also did a great job as Prince Albert, who provided much needed solace and counterpoint to Victoria. Mark Strong also did well as the slimy John Conroy, who pressured Victoria to establish a regency with her mother, the Duchess of Kent. Also worth noting is the excellent production design and costumes which faithfully (I assume) and beautifully reproduce Victorian England. There is also an incredible score and soundtrack with (mostly) period classical music. Put together, this creates a rather handsome period costume drama and romance that should appeal to a large swath of the movie-going public.\"}, {'username': 'slokes', 'rating': '6', 'helpful': '3', 'total': '3', 'date': '16 May 2012', 'title': ' Games Royals Play\\n', 'review': 'Emily Blunt displays enough star wattage to light up an Empire, and smart editing and sumptuous production design add to the overall positives of \"Young Victoria.\" While not a particularly engaging or stimulating movie, it manages to keep one interested.<br/><br/>Blunt plays the title character, a teenager about to inherit the throne of Great Britain at about the time of its world-conquering zenith, 1837. Victoria is to be a constitutional monarch, bound by the strictures of popular will. She is also bound by other forces, including the connivances of a court that doesn\\'t always wish her well. In such straits, she needs the love and support of Albert of Belgium (Rupert Friend), a real prince who also proves a prince of a guy.<br/><br/>\"I know what it is to live alone inside your head,\" he tells her, \"while never giving a clue as to your real feelings.\"<br/><br/>Friend presents Albert as a likeably awkward man of real depth, a deserving match for the ravishing Blunt. Like nearly every other reviewer here, I\\'m in awe of what she brings to the screen, beauty and charm in equal measure. I can\\'t say she\\'s a great actress here, just a compelling star with her two killer expressions, Earnestly Pained and Serenely Pleased.<br/><br/>That\\'s all she needs, though, in a movie that works more by way of effective montage sequences than dramatic arcs or character building. \"Young Victoria\" tries something I haven\\'t seen before, where one scene ends and another begins while both alternately play out on the screen for a minute or so of seamless cross-cutting. Director Jean-Marc Vallée and his editors, Jill Bilcock and Matt Garner, make this costume drama/chick flick an easy experience for those of us outside \"Young Victoria\\'s\" target demographic, keeping information on a fast boil and served up with the right amount of energy and easy flair.<br/><br/>This helps a lot, considering any lack of real conflict. When you think of it, there\\'s really nothing going on in this film that isn\\'t resolved with considerable ease.<br/><br/>{SPOILERS} We are told in the opening moments that Victoria is fighting an attempt by a conniving noble to seize power from her by getting her to agree to a regency, but even before the title credit we see her saying no and pretty much settling that. The nasty noble manhandles Victoria a couple of times and even kicks a dog just so we can hate him better, but winds up out of gas by the time she takes the throne. Then we get a constitutional crisis that doesn\\'t really seem serious, especially once Albert returns to claim his queen. Albert has his own people to get free of back home in Belgium, who want to profit politically from Albert\\'s new love, but he just ignores them and that takes care of that. {SPOILERS END}<br/><br/>There is little to distract from the spectacle that seems \"Young Victoria\\'s\" main purpose. Given the fantastic locations where the crew was allowed to film, you\\'d understand a tendency to bask in long costumed sequences with \"Zadok The Priest\" playing overhead, but Vallée doesn\\'t stay static. Changing up camera angles and perspectives, he keeps his camera on Blunt and lets her stares and reactions fill the screen.<br/><br/>Most of the time she\\'s ravishing. Sometimes she\\'s even interesting. One moment, offering a rill in this otherwise still mill pond, features an argument with Albert where she screams at him about defying her queenly authority, even commanding him to stay so she can scream at him some more. He declines, saying he is concerned for the health of the unborn baby she carries, and leaves her to huff alone.<br/><br/>Blunt in that scene asks you to not simply bathe in her beauty, but laugh at her character, succeeding well enough to make you think she has a future in movies long after her cheeks lose their rosy glow. \"Young Victoria\" seems mostly about those cheeks, though, and doesn\\'t do badly by them.'}, {'username': 'ncgraham', 'rating': '8', 'helpful': '3', 'total': '3', 'date': '10 May 2010', 'title': ' A fine period film and a wonderful love story\\n', 'review': 'I just came back from seeing The Young Victoria. What a beautiful movie! Despite some flaws, I think it\\'s probably the strongest costume drama we\\'ve had since 2006\\'s Amazing Grace, although unlike Amazing Grace I don\\'t think it\\'s going to become one of my favorites. Let me set out by stating my problem with the movie: the pacing (also a common criticism of AG, but one that I considered unfounded in that instance). A large portion of it consists of a flashback, and a very awkwardly set up flashback at that; however, even putting that sequence aside, the narrative structure is just odd. The various scenes and plot threads just seem to be cobbled together without any dramatic purpose. But then again, I caught myself thinking that this approach—while questionable artistically—might better reflect real life than a more typical scriptwriting/editing job. The ending, too, doesn\\'t feel particularly conclusive, but again this seems to be a conscious decision. Whether these things sink the movie or not is debatable, but they certainly distracted me.<br/><br/>However, The Young Victoria is also one of the best, most human love stories I\\'ve seen on the screen in many years. If what it shows us is factual, Victoria and Albert were a couple who really loved each other in every sense of the word, in spite of each others\\' mistakes, and in spite of the political maneuvering going on around them. Their refreshingly chaste courtship makes the intimacy they achieve in marriage that much more beautiful and satisfying: many of the scenes during their honeymoon period are highly sensual without being explicitly sexual, and the whole presentation just reeks of taste and class. But their relationship isn\\'t idealized, either. They fight rather bitterly at one point, but make up later. (This scene does go rather over-the-top when Victoria accuses Albert for walking over her simply because she\\'s a woman—a comment that seemed a little too modern in a movie that otherwise sticks close to the values of its period.)<br/><br/>Emily Blunt and Rupert Fiend do a beautiful job portraying this fascinating couple. Blunt manages to make Victoria a strong woman without falling into many of the standard Hollywood Strong Women clichés; again, she seems to be very much a woman of the period, but one with her own moral convictions. Friend\\'s performance is similarly refreshing. Too often men in period movies are so charismatic and \"in control\" that they don\\'t seem quite real; Friend\\'s Albert, on the other hand, is timid, quiet, and has struggled with many of the same social inhibitions as Victoria. At the same time, he never comes across as a ninny. Kudos to them both!<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is quite strong, with Paul Bettany, Miranda Richardson, Mark Strong, and Harriet Walter all giving laudable performances, but not star turns. This too is in keeping with the film: it is Victoria and Albert whom we are supposed to remember. The costumes and cinematography are simply gorgeous, and the soundtrack by Ilan Eshketi (whom people may know from Stardust) is going straight to the top of my wish-list.<br/><br/>Recommended to all costume drama lovers.'}, {'username': 'MartinHafer', 'rating': '8', 'helpful': '3', 'total': '3', 'date': '30 April 2010', 'title': ' A nice, loving portrait...\\n', 'review': 'As a history teacher, watching this sort of film is pretty natural. However, it was actually my youngest daughter and her obsession with the British monarchy that got me to watch this film. I am happy to report that this film was far better than I expected, as I usually HATE costume dramas because they are very dull and stuffy--with way too much emphasis on clothing. \"The Young Victoria\" succeeds because it attempts to show the viewer insights into the personality of the princess--not just show you a series of events from her life that are re-created on screen.<br/><br/>When the film begins, Victoria is still a year from ascending to the throne. How her mother and her mother\\'s lover attempt to manipulate her is the subject of the beginning of the film. However, surprisingly, who will manipulate and control her next seems to be the gist of the rest of the film. But, as Victoria was a strong woman, over time, she learned to strike a balance and chart her own course. This was not without a few hiccups along the way, however, and a few of them are shown in the film--though one of the more famous blunders of the period involving a dead lady-in-waiting is skipped--mostly because the film just wasn\\'t long enough to include this sticky business.<br/><br/>Much of the last third of the film involves her marriage and learning to trust and rely on Albert to be her husband and confidant. I really liked this part of the film, as the movie became amazingly romantic and touching. According to the movie, Albert was one heck of a guy--knowing that he died extremely prematurely made this all the more touching.<br/><br/>All in all, there is a lot to like in the film--even if it DID take a few liberties with the truth. For example, when an assassin tried to shoot his new bride, Albert is shown shielding her--which he DID do. However, in this and two subsequent attempts by other maniacs, Albert was NOT shot in the process! It made for better drama to have him shot--but it\\'s just not true. But, we sure wish it was!! By the way, I\\'d sure like to see some followup films from this production company--perhaps the middle period of her reign would be a great subject for another film--though I am sure a few would be turned off by how utterly sad such a film must be, as her beloved Albert died at only age 42.'}, {'username': 'stevenduhig', 'rating': '8', 'helpful': '3', 'total': '3', 'date': '21 January 2010', 'title': ' Well worth watching but is something missing..\\n', 'review': 'Enjoyed the movie very much.

Imprisoned in her Kensington Palace, she is bullied by a power hungry politician who has been allowed to rule the family nest by her weak willed mother. All the while overseas her uncle is training a young Prince Albert the art of seducing the soon to be Queen in the hope of retaining some political advantage over his rivals in Europe. You can imagine the young Princess feeling trapped, used\\x85 almost like a pawn in some sort of chess match\\x85 well actually you don't need to imagine it, the obvious metaphors and visual imagery give it away. Constant shots of gates shutting, keys turning, and doors slamming do the trick and if this doesn't work the chess game between Victoria and Albert with all eyes watching should hammer it home.<br/><br/>The overburden narrative picks up pace once Victoria takes over the throne from William IV (played by a bellowing but amusing Jim Broadbent). The costumes and locations become more sumptuous as we are introduced to the world in which Victoria must find her feet. This she does, skipping lightly into her court only to be faced with the sudden realisation that life as a Queen can be a lonely one. She makes mistakes, faces tough decisions and relies on advisors that perhaps have their own interests in mind (draw your obvious comparisons to Cate Blancett's rip roaring Elizabeth I here). Sidelined in Germany, Albert must wait until he is summoned by the Queen to take his place by her side. Once he does the love story takes stride and it is satisfyingly sweet although not as bodice ripping as one might have hoped.<br/><br/>This is the crux of the problem; the film is merely satisfying on a visual leave, more Victorian Sponge than Crème Brule. The plot's political conspiracies are not deceptive enough to carry the story so tends to falter and the two love interests do not see enough of each other to make this film burn with passion. The decision to fictionalise parts of the story by allowing Prince Albert to get shot while trying to protect Victoria from an assassin just makes the flaws in the narrative all the more obvious. It is a shame because the cast is full of strong actors and the story of Queen Victoria and the era in which she reigned is fascinating. Personally I would like to have seen more of the intense desire and attraction that Albert and Victoria shared which produced nine children and led her to mourn his passing everyday for the 40 years that followed his death.<br/><br/>Stunning costumes - tick.

Having others taste your food before you eat it? Everyone (including your overbearing mother) dictating how you live? These are only a few of the obstacles which the young Victoria has to deal with in this film (there's also the various power struggles going on, as well as attempts on her life). Needless to say, it makes for very fascinating and informative viewing.<br/><br/>I had only previously seen Emily Blunt in The Devil Wears Prada (and little else). As she was in that film, she is once again the standout here. I was extremely impressed with her portrayal of the young Victoria, and thought she handled the role very well. She makes the transition from the young Victoria we meet at the start of the film to the Queen Victoria she becomes later entirely believable. Blunt is perfectly cast in the role, showing all the different sides (from the vulnerable, to the strong, from the young Victoria who makes mistakes to the Queen who takes control). Not enough can be said about Emily Blunt in this role. She's - quite simply - exquisite, commanding your attention every second she's on screen. She keeps you transfixed up to and including the final shot of the film.<br/><br/>Rupert Friend proves to also be well-cast as Victoria's love interest (and eventual husband), Prince Albert. The actors have nice chemistry and you absolutely believe in their developing relationship. They have their disagreements, but you can tell that they are in love. Blunt and Friend are excellent in every scene that they share and keep you interested in what is happening between Victoria and Albert. The other actors in the film are also very good. Paul Bettany as Lord Melbourne, Miranda Richardson as the Duchess of Kent, Mark Strong as Sir John Conroy and Jim Broadbent as King William. There is not a single bad performance in this film. The less-focused-upon people are well-portrayed also, given what little screen time they have. Even Victoria's dog (a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel named Dash) is memorable and makes an impact in the film.<br/><br/>Although the movie does tend to skip more than a few aspects of Victoria's life - especially at the end - and instead *tells* us what happened (with her and Albert) on screen, what matters the most is what we actually *see*. This is, after all, a film about 'The Young Victoria' (not 'The Middle-Aged Victoria', nor 'The Old Victoria'). While there are some embellishments made on history with this film, it remains focused on what it sets out to do - which is tell us the story of how the young princess rose to power.<br/><br/>The movie looks amazing, the costumes Emily Blunt wears are visually stunning and the music only adds to the film, never detracts from it. It's powerful (especially at the beginning when Victoria is crowned), it packs an emotional punch where needed and the end credits song performed by Sinead O'Connor is one you'll want to sit through. Like the film and lead performances, 'Only You' is simply beautiful. The movie is exceptionally shot and, unlike a lot of films these days, it is actually a good length, as it doesn't run on so long that you lose interest or feel that it's needlessly being drawn out.<br/><br/>It goes without saying that what makes this film so great is Emily Blunt. She's in fine form here, turning in another excellent performance and elevating this film above what it might have been, had another actress been cast in this rather important/historic role. This is one finely-crafted film, with excellent performances, that should definitely be seen. If you have an appreciation for a fascinating look at a woman who was extremely significant in history, this is a must-see.\"}, {'username': 'BronzeKeilani26', 'rating': '8', 'helpful': '15', 'total': '28', 'date': '22 May 2009', 'title': ' LONG LIVE THE QUEEN!!!!!!

It looks sumptuous and features an array of pinpoint performances but is ultimately a case of biting off more than it can chew. There are simply too many things bouncing into each other in this story and some of them are far less interesting than the rest.<br/><br/>The film covers the time immediately surrounding Victoria's ascension to the throne in 1837, from her struggles to escape the infantilizing control of her mother and her mother's abusive lover to her infatuation with the great politician Lord Melbourne to her at times balky love with the eventual Price Albert\\x85and that's the problem. Any one of those stages in Victoria's life would have made an excellent movie. Throwing them all together in a movie that doesn't even last 2 hours produces a motion picture that can never be more than tantalizing at best and is a little dull at worst.<br/><br/>As it's presented here, the Duchess of Kent (Miranda Richardson) and her dominating consort Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong) tried to brainwash the young Victoria (Emily Blunt) into becoming their easily manipulated vassal. The glimpses we get of the physical and intellectual limitations they enforced upon her to mold her mind and heart and Victoria's struggles to resist are interesting, but it's all done in too abbreviated a fashion.<br/><br/>Likewise, Victoria's platonic dependence on Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany), his efforts to use that for his political advantage and the awful consequences of that to Queen and country make up a fascinating look at 19th century British society, but nearly all of the important developments occur too quickly or too much off camera to build into anything.<br/><br/>And the love of Victoria and Albert (Rupert Friend) is a very well executed version of 19th century romance, where the lovers spend more time apart than together and whose love is more theoretical than actual. But the characters spend so little time together and Albert has so little to do with the rest of the film, the audience cannot invest the relationship with enough emotion to sustain its appeal.<br/><br/>The only thing that falls truly flat is the royal intrigue that surrounds Victoria and may very well reflect what happened around the real queen. In retrospect, however, it all seems silly and The Young Victoria doesn't recognize that. By this time in history, the monarchy still retained enormous informal power as the heart and soul of British life while the monarch was left with virtually no legitimate authority or genuine responsibility. That means all the plots and schemes that people may or may not have spun involving the Queen and her favor have nothing real to grab onto or stand upon.<br/><br/>For example, King Leopold (Thomas Kretschmann) of Belgium sought to use Albert as an agent of influence to win British support for his kingdom. Albert eventually refuses to go along, but what if he hadn't? What if Albert has sought to push Victoria into using British might to prop up Leopold? Even if Victoria had been taken in by such a plan, nothing would or could have come of it. No 19th century British parliament was going to spend coin or blood for a foreign sovereign because the queen would ask, command or beg. Queen Victoria's capacity to influence matters of state was practically nil and the same problem undermines all of the other palace machinations. We can now see that even if they were successful, it wouldn't have mattered.<br/><br/>Unlike The King's Speech, which also dealt with a great many different issues touching on the British throne a century after Victoria's coronation, this production has no central, animating core providing a dramatic structure and direction. This certainly isn't a bad film, but it's only able to walk and you keep expecting it to run. If you like British period pieces, you'd surely enjoy this one.

It has the usual sort of sentimentality. But, that doesn't mean it's not a good film. Rupert Friend is his usual pretty self, very hot, but he does bring a lot to his role. He can usually be very stoic and emotionless while being just decorated as pretty, but can often not bring much to the table. Here, he absolutely does. He's able to paint the shades of his character well, even if another more talented actor could've brought even more to it. But really, the film belongs to Emily Blunt, a severely underrated actress who brings so much to her roles, and in a leading role, she can knock it out of the park like she does here.

For every other demographic watching the film, this reviewer included, the political intrigue of a dying king, an overbearing mother and a manipulative PM, however, isn't quite as rewarding.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt, who, as it has been noted, fought for this role, passing on the opportunity to co-star in the comicbook film IRON MAN 2, proved that she had every right to play the monarch and did so with a beautifully royal countenance. Along side of her, Rupert Friend is both dashing and enjoyable as her loving paramour bringing an elegance to an otherwise everyman role.<br/><br/>Where the film fails, if the telling of two people successfully in love is a failure, is that aside from the romantic yearning and positively – ahem – Victorian dating rituals practiced within, the viewer does not get to witness the social policies that her reign was responsible for or any true conflict thereof. She has almost already won before the film ends. In contrast, Shekhar Kapur's ELIZABETH (1998) weds the yearning of romance with hard, state-wide deliberations and a very dangerous conflict, thus creating a more compelling film.<br/><br/>The conflict in this film comes as a result of two different characters and types of love. The first is Paul Bettany in an outstanding performance as Lord Melbourne, Queen Victoria's PM. Melbourne courts Victoria and offers love but his is a love of power with wedding Victoria as a clever and manipulative means to grabbing all. The other is King William played by Jim Broadbent, truly the king of acting nobility, who loves his niece and realizes that his own paternal instincts were denied by allowing the Duchess of Kent, her mother, to control every aspect of the young soon-to-be-queen's life. Alas, Broadbent's scenes are shorter than a drink of champagne and Bettany's are as political as the U.S. President in any Jerry Bruckheimer presentation.<br/><br/>THE YOUNG VICTORIA is an enjoyable, romantic film to watch with clever dialogue and outstanding locations.

Set in the period just before and in the early years of Victoria's reign as Queen of England, there is a definite sense of authenticity that flows throughout this movie. <br/><br/>The story itself revolves essentially around two aspects of Victoria's early life. The first deals with the troubled relationships that existed within the royal family. Victoria's uncle was King William IV - a man who only became King at the age of 64 and had a touch of eccentricity about him. Since William was childless, the heir to the throne was his niece Victoria. Victoria's mother and her partner Sir John Conroy (who many believe was her lover) conspired to take control of England themselves by convincing Victoria to establish a regency. William, however, survived until Victoria's 18th birthday, and Victoria - hostile to Conroy and unsympathetic to her mother - refused to consider a regency, instead reigning in her own right. This was an interesting view of royal life and of some of the intrigues taking place behind the scenes, as well as a somewhat rare depiction of William IV, who's largely forgotten today. The second part of the story dealt with the growing relationship and eventual romance between Victoria and her cousin, Prince Albert of Saxe, Coburg and Gotha. This took up the bulk of the movie, although I would say personally that I found the political machinations within and without the royal family more interesting. It was, however, a good (and corrective) look at a side of Victoria rarely reflected upon. The image we have of her tends to be of her later life - after Albert's death, when she went into extended mourning. Her name sums up an era (the Victorian) widely seen as passionless and, frankly, somewhat dull. Thus, it's refreshing to see Victoria shown as passionately in love with Albert (which she was in truth.)<br/><br/>Emily Blunt's performance as Victoria was top-notch, with Rupert Friend offering a very good performance as Albert. Friend was appropriately in Blunt's shadow for most of the movie, just as Albert would have been in Victoria's. This is an interesting take on Victoria's early life. It's not especially exciting, and adds nothing really that anyone with knowledge of the outline of Victoria's life wouldn't know already (which, of course, also means that it isn't hopelessly romanticized, although the scene in which Albert takes a bullet for Victoria is complete myth, as was the idea that was mentioned that Victoria's marriage made her more popular, when in fact her marriage to Albert was not popular at first with the public) but it's still a good watch.\"}, {'username': 'moviemanMA', 'rating': '7', 'helpful': '2', 'total': '2', 'date': '25 April 2010', 'title': ' A nice story with lots of evening wear\\n', 'review': 'The Young Victoria luckily has a story, and even better than that, it has good actors. That\\'s where a film like The Other Boleyn Girl fails. The acting just didn\\'t match the characters. Emily Blunt, who has quickly risen up the ranks into Hollywood A-list status, gives one of her better performances, worthy of her Golden Globe nomination, as the famed English monarch Queen Victoria.<br/><br/>The film follows Victoria in the year leading up to her coronation and into the first few years of her reign, including her relationship of Prince Albert (Rupert Friend). Victoria was a very protected and sheltered princess who was under constant surveillance by her mother and close friend and adviser. Victoria was next in line to take the crown once the King had passed, on so naturally a lot of attention as to when she would ascend to the thrown and how was being discussed. One thing is clear; Victoria does not want to be treated like a child.<br/><br/>Her budding romance with Prince Albert starts before she is made Queen. The Prince is selected to try and win her affection as a political ally, but one thing leads to another and the two become smitten with each other. Albert is aware that the two of them are very young and must look out for one another, especially in the realm of politics. So called \"friends\" can become powerful influences on the crown, especially in the case of Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany), who imposes his political party\\'s agenda upon the queen in a back door sort of way, surrounding her with his own people.<br/><br/>Victoria learns quickly, and so do we, that the game of politics is a dicey one. It\\'s hard to see which side people are really on, and by the time you do it might be too late.<br/><br/>I was pleased with the pace and direction of this movie. It could have been too much about the fashion or too much about the politics, but it balanced the two out pretty well. Blunt and Friend are fine opposite each other, playfully going back and forth with their Victorian era flirtations. There is a definite bond their that shows up well on screen.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast does an excellent job. Bettany, Miranda Richardson as Victoria\\'s mother the Duchess of Kent, Mark Strong as Sir John Conroy, the Duchess\\' adviser, and a nice cameo by Jim Broadbent as an ailing King William. Bettany in particular plays his role quite well, never really telling us whether he is helping the Queen out or trying to do good for himself alone.<br/><br/>The costumes are quite authentic and well made. They don\\'t always distract the viewer\\'s eye but at times they are a bit showy. I guess those were the times. The sets are incredibly detailed. I particularly liked the attention paid to the little knick-knacks and pieces of furniture in the bedrooms and studies.

What greater delight is there than watching a nice, good romance while learning a good portion of history, all enveloped in an exquisitely-crafted film? Jean-Marc Vallée\\'s charming \"The Young Victoria\" skillfully lives up to the aforementioned characteristics, and creates a feel-good movie experience that has your heart guzzling and your mind racing in excitement throughout its entirety.<br/><br/>Yes, we love monarchs and their epic, larger-than-life experiences. One such monarch we all fondly remember is Queen Victoria, born in 1819 and assuming the throne at a very early age. King William (Jim Broadbent) is soon to die, Victoria is soon to come of age, and all around Europe rise interweaving conspiracies and plots to have Victoria sign an order of regency extending her powers to someone else and/or having someone seduce her with wit and modern political ideas and therefore influence her reign towards favoring a particular country or political party. But Victoria isn\\'t as silly as everyone thinks, and she has a mind of her own...which is constantly been careened back and forth between diverging influences such as the Duchess of Kent\\'s (Miranda Richardson) trying to make her renounce power to the evil Baron Stockmar, or Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany) gaining her favour to help establish himself as Prime Minister...or Albert Conroy (Rupert Friend), King Leopold\\'s nephew, who begins to fall in love with her while being part of a plot to earn the queen\\'s protection of the Belgians.<br/><br/>Among all these conspiracies and mind-boggling plots is the shy, growing romance between Victoria and Albert. The film is about history, politics and the nature of regents, but above all these subjects the love these characters feel triumph above all else and end up in one of the best regencies England has ever seen and one of the best love stories ever told. Jean-Marc Vallée does a wonderful job in toning down the film to a light-hearted level, where the history is enjoyable and where the love story unfolding isn\\'t stale and clichéd but original and refreshing. And Emily Blunt\\'s performance as the young, strong-willed and charming Victoria is excellent and enthralling; she wins you over from the start and opens up Victoria\\'s heart and mind to the audience, making it easy for us to love Victoria the Woman and to relate to her and her life problems, no matter how epically different they are from our own.<br/><br/>The screenplay is dazzling, such as we\\'ve come to expect from screenwriter Julian Fellowes (Gosford Park), and the film has that sublime, breath-taking, age-old beauty we can expect from lush, sweeping cinematography, mellow and inviting score and top-notch costume design. It\\'s a film that doesn\\'t depend on the acting, screen-writing or directing alone, but whose every part fit perfectly together into a pleasing, well-coordinated whole.<br/><br/>The film never lags, but sometimes it carries a particular emotion too far to the point where it loses it strength, or sometimes it cuts abruptly between scenes (and countries) in its attempt to fully involve us in every conspiracy or in every character\\'s setting that we lose interest in most of the secondary characters and await impatiently to the flowering, letter-driven romance between Victoria and Albert. And what\\'s with the rushed ending? You\\'re enjoying the film, completely taken in by the story, and all of a sudden we get a black screen with an epilogue. It\\'s not a grand flaw of the film, but it does inhibit it from becoming a masterpiece to rival such productions as \"Shakespeare in Love\" or \"Elizabeth\".<br/><br/>I highly recommend it!

What makes it an interesting movie is that the young woman happens to be the Queen of England. The love story between Queen Victoria and Prince Albert has been told many times. This particular account of their romance succeeds because of several factors. It has great production values, it has reasonable historical accuracy, and it has Emily Blunt as Victoria. <br/><br/>The production values are what we expect from a BBC-style historical drama. It's impossible to deny the pleasure of watching actors wearing period costumes as they move through great English manor houses and castles.<br/><br/>Experts in Victoriana point out lapses in historical details, but, as far as I can tell, the main historical aspects of the film are accurate. More importantly, the plot goes beyond politics to emphasize the stultifying atmosphere in which Victoria was raised. Until she reaches her majority, her life is ruled by her overbearing mother. The fact that Victoria survived this upbringing with her psyche more or less unscathed is a testament to her psychological resilience. This makes the story more than simply a historical drama.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt is perfect as the young Victoria. Her attractive features are enhanced by her flawless, glowing complexion. She does, indeed, bear a likeness to portraits of Queen Victoria as a young woman, and she is as convincing in her role as Helen Mirren was as Queen Elizabeth II.<br/><br/>This movie is worth seeing as a love story and as a study of the psychological attributes of a young woman whose circumstances have made her a queen. It will lose something on a small screen, but it's worth seeking out on DVD if unavailable in a theater.<br/><br/>P.S.

What I liked most was that despite the gleaming aesthetics of the costumes and the settings, all gilded and shiny, this aspect never took over the heart of the film which was good, strong writing (thank you Julian Fellowes :D); nothing too flamboyant or saturated with pomp, i.e not sensationalised greatly (when Victoria is dragged out of bed to be informed she is now Queen, well you couldn't get a less glamorous hand over of the crown). It was paced gently and every line in the film held its worth.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly the portrayal of the love between Victoria and Albert, though somewhat fairytale-ish on the face it, was in fact a slow burning candle and Friend and Blunt did well to show how effortlessly these two people 'fitted' together despite the union being initially arranged (my fave bit was when they come home after hunting and Victoria simply hugs her new husband from behind; so much said without any words, that's what film is all about). Blunt held her own beautifully as well, she has a face that demands your attention and I can't not mention the costumes that she wears - every one simply gorgeous. If I was Blunt I would have trouble parting with any of them! The rest of the ensemble cast all played their roles well, Harriet Walter as Queen Adelaide being a highlight.<br/><br/>The only qualm I have, is that it lacked a sense of urgency, or an event that could have made the movie a little more exciting? (It was rather tame) I don't know, I wanted 'something' to happen that would have Victoria draw out some strength and prove her worth a little more. When she and Albert argued, I loved it, I could have done with some more pivotal dramatic moments, though that may be just me.<br/><br/>Lastly, at the risk of sounding all patriotic, it did renew a sort of pride and awe in the crown and what it takes to be in such a position, especially in one so young. This may be in part to the fact that this film's snap shot of Victoria's young life is immediately apt to what I have been writing for one character of mine in 'The Sword & The Scion' but nevertheless, it did flag up those feelings (for those following my book, can you guess what character Victoria so aptly reflects?) It might have been in part to the film displaying how ridiculous the government were back in those times as they didn't seem to give two hoots about the poor and dispossessed of the nation, which only in turns renews appreciation that Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were so active in this domestic domain.

Foremost among the various plot threads is her romance with the dashing Prince Albert\\x85 but there\\'s more to it than just a lavish historical love story. A reasonable effort has been made to show some of the other events – like relationships, power struggles, political jockeying, and so on – that characterised the era. Certain scenes have been added by writer Julian Fellowes purely for dramatic effect – King William IV\\'s rude rant at the banquet; Prince Albert being injured protecting his bride from an attempted assassination; etc. – but in all fairness, it is the right of any film-maker to embellish bits of their story for the sake of an involving narrative. I don\\'t like it when history is utterly ignored and re-written, but in this case the overall essence of the story remains true to the facts. As historical movies go, this is one of the more reliable and worthwhile examples from recent times.<br/><br/>As a child Victoria (Michaela Brooks) is over-protected in the most preposterous manner; she isn\\'t even allowed to walk down a flight of stairs unsupervised. All this is because she is next in line to the British throne when the current monarch, William IV (Jim Broadbent), passes away. Vultures are already manoeuvring around the grown up Victoria (Emily Blunt), working their way into her trust so that they will benefit from an allegiance with her when her day of reckoning eventually comes. Her mother The Duchess of Kent (Miranda Richardson) and adviser Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong) constantly pressurise her into accepting them as joint-Regents when she assumes the throne. Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany), a future contender for Prime Minister, works his way into her affections and plants those loyal to his cause in positions of power within the palace. Even her cousin, Albert of Saxe-Coburg (Rupert Friend), is sent to form an alliance with her for political gain. As time goes by, Victoria realises that everyone is jockeying around her for their personal gain, and decides the best approach will be to make decisions of her own. Against the odds, she and Prince Albert find themselves falling in love\\x85 and together they somehow chart a route through all the intrigue and plotting and avarice around them, emerging a devoted married couple with the best interests of their kingdom at heart.<br/><br/>Blunt initially seems a risky choice as Victoria. She\\'s a new and little known actress, asked to carry the whole film. If she fails, the film fails – she is, after all, prominent in more-or-less every scene. Yet she delivers a warm and convincing portrayal as the young queen. My only real criticism, if it can be called that, is that she is probably too attractive for the role (even in her youth the actual Victoria was not an overly beautiful woman). Rupert Friend also does very nicely as Albert, while the bigger stars are reserved for lively supporting parts or cameo appearances. The film is certainly lavishly shot, with sumptuous sets and costumes. It\\'s \"history-lite\" in many ways, breaking down the complexities of the events so that they can be understood more easily and presented in a dramatically engaging way. Other viewers have noted that the second half of the film pretty much concentrates on the love elements, dwelling on the romance, and throwing at us those old love story clichés like kissing in the rain.

I can't help but feel like this is a Mills & Boon novel adaptation compared to a darker, more dramatic movie about another young queen, Elizabeth.

She was a bright intelligent and according to the history of her early years, a fun loving happy young woman. Her love of Albert was the essence of true love, and even if you only count the number of children she bore (9), they must have had a passionate relationship. All of this is well borne out in the film. To this end, the cast has been well selected with both Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend giving sound performances as Victoria and Albert.<br/><br/>(SPOILER ALERT) The historical accuracy is somewhat questionable as at no time did Prince Albert get shot while defending Victoria. There was at least one assassination attempt when they were out together, but nobody was struck by the shot/s. I also found it odd that little was done to expand on the allegedly intimate relationship between Victoria's mother and Sir John Conroy. It is quite likely that this relationship was the true reason for Victoria's distaste for both her mother and Conroy. I also found it odd that there was an attempt to portray the relationship between Victoria and Lord Melbourne as erring on the romantic, or at least having the potential to become romantic. He was already in his late 50's when Victoria came to the throne, and while marriages between older men and young women were common in that era, the movie portrays Melbourne as being a dashing 30 something and rival to Prince Albert. There were apparently rivals to Albert, but she could never have married even slightly below her station in life, and Albert was one of only a handful who would have been acceptable in any case.<br/><br/>All in all I have spent worse times at the cinema, and brownie points with my wife can't be a bad thing either.\"}, {'username': 'scooterberwyn', 'rating': '6', 'helpful': '5', 'total': '9', 'date': '20 February 2010', 'title': ' Lovely to look at, but ultimately disappointing\\n', 'review': \"I had expected great things of this film.

The reality is somewhat different and \"Young Victoria\" goes some way towards putting the record straight,depicting the queen as an intelligent and independent young woman conscious of the inequities in her society and at her court. Courts have always been hotbeds of seething jealousy,plotting and counter-plotting,naked ambition and sometimes,outright murder. As an 18 year old innocent,Victoria ascended to her uncle\\'s throne,thus initiating a positive orgy of intrigue and a power-struggle between Prime minister Lord Melbourne and his rival Sir Robert Peel. Lord Melbourne cuts a dash in the Old Public School Man kind of way with his finely-honed cynicism and his well-polished gems of advice. Hardly surprising then that the young queen finds herself in awe of him,and even perhaps a little in love,an awe that he ruthlessly exploits,drawing a fine line between attempted seduction and attempted sedition as he forces his policies through against Victoria\\'s better judgement. Into the arena rides Prince Albert,on a mission from King Leopold of Belgium,keen on political rapprochement between Great Britain and the rest of Europe. At first a reluctant suitor,he soon falls in love with the English queen and palliates the influence of the politicians and courtiers. \"The Young Victoria\" is a beautifully photographed,brilliantly-scored and very sumptuous movie.I note that it has been criticised in some quarters for this sumptuousness as if a movie about 19th century English Royalty should somehow have shown the Empress of India and her family living in rags in a filthy workhouse........I don\\'t think so. I must single out the remarkable Miss Emily Blunt whose beauty reminded me of the young Princess Margaret\\'s.Hers is obviously the pivotal role, and she has absolutely no trouble in dominating the film despite strong performances from Mr Jim Broadbent,Miss Miranda Richardson and Miss Harriet Walter,all immeasurably more experienced. The music is suitably regal and forms a cohesive part of the whole movie without being in any way obtrusive. The fact that Britan flourished more under its two great queens,Elizabeth the First and Victoria,than at any other time is a matter Feminists might like to make more of,but,I suspect,like Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher really powerful women make them feel uncomfortable.If you can work out why there might be a Ph.D . in it.'}, {'username': 'bob-1070', 'rating': '2', 'helpful': '10', 'total': '23', 'date': '21 November 2009', 'title': ' Unnecessary - watch the TV mini-series instead\\n', 'review': 'I can only wonder why they bothered making this film so soon after the excellent and far superior 2001 TV production \"Victoria and Albert.\" In comparison with that version, this one fails on almost every level.

That\\'s unfortunate given how lively Emily Blunt can be in any number of on screen roles she has undertaken (\"The Devil Wears Prada\", \"Sunshine Cleaning\"). The key problem is that Julian Fellowes\\' sensitive albeit dull screenplay focuses on what was obviously a happy marriage between Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, the consequence of which doesn\\'t give rise to much dramatic fire unless wrapped conveniently in political intrigue, insanity or war. Attempts to add sharper edges to their love story wring hollow because at heart, Victoria is not presented as that compelling a historical figure.<br/><br/>Because of her station in life, the teenaged Victoria is unable to rebel with any conviction. Her scheming, Machiavellian mother, the Duchess of Kent controls her every move, while her adviser John Conroy manipulates the duchess and her daughter with strong-arm tactics with the aim of forcing Victoria have him rule in her stead before she can mature into her role. However, Victoria steadfastly declines his directives in favor of ascending the throne herself upon the death of her beloved uncle, the cantankerous King William IV. Although young and naive, she rises to the challenge of becoming her country\\'s soon-to-be longest-reigning monarch. In the midst of this transition, she falls for her cousin Albert even though he has been aggressively coached by her uncle, King Leopold of Belgium, to ensure a match occurs.<br/><br/>Once Victoria confronts Albert about his ruse, their affection builds and turns into a marriage of mutual devotion with a common dedication to the expansion of arts and science in the empire. The only compelling barrier to Victoria and Albert\\'s happiness is the cagey Lord Melbourne, her trusted, almost-Svengali-like adviser, whose motives remain murky and highly suspect throughout the five-year span of the story told in the movie. Blunt handles her stately role with aplomb, injecting the right level of vulnerability to a character whose ultimate calling came so early in her life. Unfortunately, compared to Cate Blanchett\\'s meaty opportunities in the first \"Elizabeth\", she is not given any scenes that take advantage of her innate fieriness. By comparison, Rupert Friend comes across a bit too pallid to make any real impression as Albert.<br/><br/>Other worthy actors are given too little to do to strike more than single notes in their performances, for example, Miranda Richardson\\'s petulant turn as the duchess, Mark Strong\\'s Conroy trivialized into a stock villain, and Paul Bettany almost too subtly ambiguous as Melbourne. Only Jim Broadbent stands out in just three scenes as King William. The production details are executed just right from Hagen Bogdanski\\'s clear-eyed cinematography to Patrice Vermette\\'s sumptuous production design to Sandy Powell\\'s pageantry of costumes. The 2010 DVD includes 22 minutes of deleted and extended scenes, a standard making-of featurette, a short comparing the movie\\' title character with the real Queen Victoria, in-depth looks at the film\\'s coronation and wedding scenes, and a final piece that focuses on the costumes and locations.

I have not been this fascinated with a young actress since Cate Blanchett burst upon the scene over ten years ago. And although both Blanchett and Blunt have played Queens now( seems to be the benchmark for up and coming actresses), the roles are complete polar opposites.<br/><br/>Simply put if you are looking for high passion, compelling drama, and Machiavellian intrigue, this is not the movie for you. This isn\\'t to say that the script or direction was bad, its just that the subject of the film did not lead too dramatic a life when compared to other notable royals like Elizabeth I, Anne Boylen, Henry VIII, Henry V, Henry II and Elainor of Acquitane. These are people whose lives were the stuff such as good soap operas are made of and whose policies and decisions altered the course of British ,and in most cases, world history. Victoria, in contrast, ascended the throne without incident, she quasi-governed a nation that was fast becoming a global power due to industrialization and the rise of the Navy, her State had a stable government led by competent and dynamic politicians, and she married young had a harmonious family life. The facts of her life are not the Sturm und Drag such as powerful dramas are made of.<br/><br/>The heart of the film, aside from the attempt to dramatize her stultifying upbringing and the machinations surrounding her throne, is the story of the one thing that was truly shocking and surprising about her reign- a love story. Marriage made for financial or political reasons is with reason not necessarily the place to look for world shaking passion, yet Victoria will always be remembered in history as being sort of a Patron Saint marital fidelity, happiness and ideal family life. Thus, central to the film is the budding love of Victoria and her Prince Albert. I was very taken with Rupert Friend\\'s characterization of Albert whom he portrayed as a kind, patient, somewhat earnest and maybe a touch naive young man, looking to\" do good in the world and help\". In short, he is a good man with a good heart, not the most dynamic figure to base a drama around, but as that is not the point of the story, that does not matter. The heart of the character shines through thanks to Friend\\'s understated yet earnest performance. <br/><br/>As for the Queen, well..Emily Blunt is sublime. Her beauty cannot be denied, but she is more than something pretty to look at; her face is like quicksilver because of her expressiveness. The slightest arch of the eyebrow, glance of the eye or slight wry smile delivers so much. Again, this is not a bombastic performance of heavy speeches and impassioned pleas, its not that kind of movie. But what Ms. Blunt does do with the role is show the simple humanity of the character with potent subtlety. <br/><br/>For example, we see the joie de vivre that has been kept in check by Victoria\\'s mother ( Miranda Richardson) and her scheming adviser/lover Conroy expressed in the simple things like Victoria trying to sketch her dog. We see her delight and fascination upon first meeting Albert by her eyes being continually drawn to him. We see her nervous and overwhelmed when addressing Parliament upon her Ascension. And my favorite scene of all in the film- we see her nervous, happy, and hopeful as she steels herself to do what really most women never have to do in their life- ask the man she loves to marry her, a proposition so ridiculous for those times( and some would say now) that Victoria bursts out in nervous laughter before she can even say \"marry me\". Again, this is not a movie for over the top larger than life expressions, but more a study in the subtleties of a character and making the little things say so much.<br/><br/>So, overall, I judge the film by what it is and what it tried to do and as such I give it a 7. I felt that some of the politics could be better explained and that some very fine actors were wasted with little do and little character development, namely Miranda Richardson as the Duchess of Kent, and the characters of Conroy and Lord Peal. Again, the film need not have spent a large amount of time on those characters, but a little more exposition would have helped to explain the political environment. Also I would have loved to have seen more of the adjustment to married life between Victoria and Albert, but that may be just my greed for more scenes between Friend and Blunt. <br/><br/>In summary, don\\'t view this film in terms of a historical drama but for what it really is, a love story between two characters that happen to be historical figures. I give this film a solid 7 for wonderful lead performances, brilliant costumes and scenery and the magnificent Victoria of Emily Blunt. And anyone who has any shred of romance left in them, you will be touched by the end of this movie.

To the global audience (and perhaps even some in the British audience), Queen Victoria is probably no more than a caricature with a balloon caption \"We are not amused\". A G&S fan, such as myself, may also recall the Penzance Pirates\\' passionate \"with all our faults, we love our Queen\". But Emily Blunt, as reported in Time Out, Hong Kong, talks about the Queen at her youth being \"sort of the polar opposite\" to the persona later in her life. \"She was so vivacious and had such a zealous approach to life. She was kind of rebellious\", Blunt explains. And she did a marvellous job in projecting that image of the young Queen on screen.<br/><br/>The whole thing is made look like a fairy tale, and I suspect intentionally, by the movie makers who must feel that there has been enough gloom and doom in these palace period pieces all the way back to \"Ann of a thousand days\". In \"Young Victoria\", which depicts the short period of a few years from before to after her coronation, there is a surprising lack of tension. Indeed, there is the expected political intrigue involving the power struggle from no less than three factions to control Victoria: Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong) through her mother Duchess of Kent (Miranda Richardson), King Leopold of Belgium (Thomas Kretschmann) through prospective suitor Prince Albert (Rupert Friend) and Lord MelBourne (Paul Bettany) through himself as a father/elder brother figure. But in the way it was presented in the movie, there was never any real threat. Conroy losses steam as soon as Victoria becomes Queen upon the death of King William (Jim Broadbent). Melbourne, portrayed initially with some innuendo as a selfish sly fox, turns out to be impeccably loyal. And things didn\\'t quite work out for Leopold because Albert, upon marrying the Queen, loses no time in making it known in no uncertain terms that he is nobody\\'s pawn.<br/><br/>So we are left with Victoria and Albert rendering the movie into a sweet romance with a fairy tale ending, punctuated by Schubert\\'s popular music. For melodramatic effect, the movie makers inserted one tiny ripple towards the end of the movie with a storm-in-tea-cup quarrel. At one point, it almost seems that The Mikado\\'s (apologies for one more G&S reference) philosophical motto rules: \"it\\'s an unjust world, and virtue is triumphant only in theatrical performances\". Not so here, in this cinematic performance (and in real history, incidentally). Virtue did triumph and they did live happily ever after\\x85well, \"ever after\" with qualification. Victoria and Albert did have twenty years of happy and rewarding life together before his unfortunate death from a fatal disease at 41, followed by her devoted widowhood of 40 year. The early widowhood is indeed tragic. But in the lyrics of \"Hello young lovers\" (musical \"The king and I\", sung by widow Anna), \"I\\'ve had a love of my own\", the Queen may find some comfort.<br/><br/>As mentioned, Blunt is good. The regal stance she adopts (still in her nightgown) immediately upon hearing the news of the King\\' demise is particularly worth watching. The next one to watch is Bettany, versatile character actor who has played just about anything from eccentric Chaucer, to resourceful warship surgeon, to fanatic assassin. Here, he delivers Melbourne expertly with all the subtleties and nuances expected of an actor with his calibre. Friend\\'s performance should be good enough to draw out some sighs of yearning from a certain demographic segment of the audience, thought perhaps not quite making Robert Pattinson nervous yet. Broadbent has his moment has the charismatic (the bellowing variety) King William. The rest of the cast also gives good, solid support.'}, {'username': 'Chanandler-Bong', 'rating': '10', 'helpful': '2', 'total': '3', 'date': '9 March 2010', 'title': ' An epic!\\n', 'review': \"This is on my top list of all-time favourite films!

It also deals with fight of her custodians to try to gain reigns of power from her. It was avoided since the previous sovereign lived enough for Victoria to turn 18. Britan became super power during her reign and it is interesting to see how the early years of pre reign passed. Acting is excellent, costumes have to be excellent, it is a costume drama after all, and all is in red, color of the British royals. If you are into British royals, and you probably are, since half of the world is, it is a film for you. It is interesting to note that during Victoria time Britain was devoid of the fight for throne like in the earlier centuries, and the question of religion is not as acute as during the reign of Henry VIII or Elizabeth I.'}, {'username': 'chriskunselman', 'rating': '6', 'helpful': '1', 'total': '1', 'date': '29 April 2013', 'title': ' adequate but slight\\n', 'review': 'this movie looked gorgeous and most of the acting, especially from blunt and bettany was very good but it was too heavily edited. i watched the DVD extras and most of the deleted scenes in my humble opinion should have been left in, especially the lady hastings affair. while watching the movie the affairs of state come across as confused at times due to the lack of depth in the story. now i understand this is mainly a love story about the queen and albert but w/people of such monumental historical import the backdrops and intrigues can only enhance even a love story if handled correctly. still, an enjoyable biopic just not definitive.'}, {'username': 'tim-764-291856', 'rating': '7', 'helpful': '1', 'total': '1', 'date': '25 January 2013', 'title': ' Rather Charmless and Forgettable....\\n', 'review': \"Don't get me wrong, Emily Blunt seems perfect as the young Queen, her diction exemplary, her poise Regal.

Not that I'm necessarily wanting to get back to the VHS quality of 1980s 'costume drama', mind you!<br/><br/>Maybe it's because many of the characters are portrayed as hard-nosed and bitchy, out of date and greedy. This does highlight the romantic side of the film, though, between Victoria and Albert, as they get to know each other, but this takes a good while to reach and isn't as clammily awful as it could have been. Endearing almost, which is a bit distant from the often perceived hardness of the monarch in her more documented reign of later life.<br/><br/>It's entertaining enough with some gorgeous photography of some lovely stately homes and is perfect fodder for a dark early winter's evening. There's no sex or violence, though adults will be in no doubt when those bits take place, hence the PG certificate.<br/><br/>As a history lesson, it's OK, it's never rammed down our throats and if we choose, we can just let it run and simply enjoy the surface sheen. The acting never really is raised beyond what is needed - Jim Broadbent as King William IV shouting very loudly at a huge banquet might be considered as full-bodied acting but it's not necessarily good. The two main players do have their moments but Julian Fellowes' (writer also of Downton Abbey) screenplay is necessarily rather clipped and to the point - I don't think small-talk was the done thing in Victoria's household!<br/><br/>So, good solid entertainment that's good to look at and which should please the Period Drama brigade as well as reaching a wider - and younger, audience.

It felt cheesy at times then, but it does set up the central conflict of the film.<br/><br/>The period pieces and drama are just really, really beautiful.

I kept trying to remember the color patterns of the gowns; they were so stylish. It\\'s so inspiring. It\\'s surprisingly historically accurate: they have a play on a that famous drawing where Victoria is told that she is queen, while still in her nightgown, with the councillors bowing down before her, which I thought was surprisingly sensitive. One reviewer says, \"I doubt if (the king) would have gone so far as to bawl abuse at (his sister in law) during a state banquet\". It\\'s funny enough but the true story was that he did publicly yell at Victoria\\'s mother while proclaiming his intention to \\'carry on\\' until his lovely niece turned 18, so I loved to see that scene on film-- it\\'s crazy to believe it actually happened.

This is merely printed before the credits roll at the end of the film.<br/><br/>Her life was certainly not an easy one. Losing her father early and under the domination of a mother and her difficult adviser, Victoria had to put up with the regent King William, the dead brother of her father, the late king.

There is a dominating prime minister and almost a calamity in a scandal involving the Queen's ladies in waiting.

However, such an ascension was easier said than done, for there were those who believed that the sheltered young woman was just a bit too naïve in the ways of the world to successfully carry out the duties of a leader of the British Empire. The movie also focuses on the romance between the princess and her German cousin, Prince Albert (Rupert Friend), who sees in Victoria a woman of independent thought and strong will - a quick-witted individual who has the ability to see through much of the palace politics and behind-the-scenes machinations going on around her. Yet, the fly-in-the-ointment comes in the form of Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany), Prime Minister of England and a first-class manipulator, who charms his way into becoming the young queen\\'s personal confidante and helper, largely in control of the people she sees and the decisions she makes - a relationship that ultimately threatens to bring on a constitutional crisis for the nation and that finally comes to a head once the queen has chosen Prince Albert to be her husband.<br/><br/>Directed by Jean-Marc Vallee, \"The Young Victoria\" is a visually opulent costume drama that, nevertheless, manages to keep its characters relatable and life-sized. This is due, in large part, to Emily Blunt, who makes of the queen a modern, forward-looking young woman who takes her royal duties and her commitment to her subjects, especially the downtrodden ones, with the utmost seriousness. The always reliable Jim Broadbent also scores as the aging and irascible king who precedes her on the throne. Still, the screenplay by Julian Fellowes could probably have done with a little less fawning over the royal couple, as I\\'m sure their romance was not quite as idyllic or their lives and personalities quite as unyieldingly noble as they are depicted herein.<br/><br/>Stylistically, the movie may be elegant and stately, but it\\'s rarely stilted or stuffy.

Contrast to that the ever-effective Mr. Bettany as usually polishing his unsympathetic self, and the thing is already edgy as a lump.<br/><br/>Fluffy, too (one muses over how much importance did the casting gave to miss Blunt\\'s chin resembling the one Queen Victoria had, and abides on the memory of that old \\'French and Saunders\\' romp \"me likey! look alikey!\") and then oops! we have fallen into the carriage.<br/><br/>An attempt has been made toward our person.<br/><br/>Of course, no such thing in the affair called biography-must-show-integrity has the melodramatic accuracy exemplified by the film, but who gives a damn if the historic Albert was never involved in such a thing, since one can please the masses with such a dramatic pinnacle!<br/><br/>That slow-mo pinnacle condemns the film as a hoax, if not as the perennial ass-kissing aspiration to a monarchy we never witnessed, let alone had.<br/><br/>The film is a stately nuanced execution, but in a mocking manner, of what the philosopher Hegel, upon witnessing Napoleon passing on his horse, said: that he saw the State passing. If only we had that kind of awe-inspiring effect ensured by a film. But it seems the sensibility we get is like the one John Waters attacked in \\'Serial Mom\\', in the scene where the inane viewer goes for one more round of John Huston\\'s \"Annie\".

This is one of the best that I have seen. It tells the story of a young Queen Victoria when she first ascends to the thrown and falls in love with Prince Albert.Emily Blunt play the lead and does a fantastic job. Victoria is portrayed as feisty, passionate and strong willed, this is a far cry from the image of Victoria in her later years when she is a little fat old lady who is constantly in mourning and has a white hankie on her head. There is a definite change to Victoria after she is crowned as she gains power so now longer must she be bullied by Sir John (played by Mark Strong) or treated like a china doll by her fussy Mother (Played by Miranda Richardson). What I found quite shocking is that she still had her sanity after she had been forced to share a room with her Mother and be walked up and down the stairs while holding someones hand. Also Victoria was very normal I found as she fit in with all the snooty royals that were around her. During a banquet she befriends Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany), I found his character quite odd as I was never sure what his motives were as a point he was taking advantage of her and then other he was generally concerned for her. Prince Albert was played by the lovely Rupert Friend who showed exactly why Victoria and himself where meant to be together. My favourite scene is the marriage proposal where she asks him to marry her, it had me tearing up! There is also a fiery argument between the two which shows that it was a real relationship but a love that is so strong that it had a lifelong impact on both parties. At the end of the film there is an event that causes Victoria to push their desks together and work as one. All in all a fantastic film that I really enjoyed and did get a bit hysterical, with a beautiful song by Sinead O' Connor in the credits to put the cherry on the top!\"}, {'username': 'blogandsqualor', 'rating': '8', 'helpful': '3', 'total': '6', 'date': '20 December 2009', 'title': ' Blunt and Friend Sparkle, Wish the Film Did\\n', 'review': \"It's hard to find an outright bad historical drama that's based on the life of any number of British monarchs. Just take a well respected British or Australian actor, make things look pretty, and you're guaranteed a formula for Oscar success.<br/><br/>The Young Victoria is no exception, getting just about everything right, the cinematography striking and beautiful, with soft lights and lush colors and fabrics. Starring Emily Blunt in a role she can finally soar in, the film begins with Victoria's 18th birthday and moves through the intrigue and issues that surrounded her eventual rise to the throne and her famous marriage to Prince Albert (Rupert Friend). As the young Victoria herself laments, she's moved like a chess pawn by a variety of parties as she finds her footing and her voice as one of Britain's most influential rulers.<br/><br/>While this moving around the chess board is fairly typical territory, it is the development of Victoria's relationship with Albert that makes the film slightly more interesting. I confess: I have a degree in history with a specialization in the Victorian era, so I'm a bit attached to these figures. Despite their many flaws as rulers, Victoria and Albert were some of the first leaders devoted to improving civilization for their people. They left their legacy in the arts, in public health and education, and in Victoria's conservative views and mourning culture after Albert's death. But these things are only briefly hinted at during the film.<br/><br/>It is fairly well established that Victoria and Albert were not only madly in love, but held a level of respect for each other not usually seen between monarchs in arranged marriages. Even if it did occur behind the scenes, their's was certainly one of the best known. Blunt and and Friend have just the right type of chemistry to do the famous pair justice, the proper mix of restraint and desperation. It's a different love, not usually shown on screen, especially in this sort of film. It's encouraging to finally see a relationship in which man and woman are on a equal playing field.<br/><br/>But we don't get to see that love enough. While the filmmakers try to fit the affair amongst the political trappings, it doesn't quite build up the sort of momentum needed to keep the tension high. Also, without delving into the more advanced important public work of the pair, things feel a bit in limbo, superficial instead of intimate, and sometimes confusing. It's not as big an issue during the film, but afterward, the effects wear off rather quickly and you find yourself trying to remember what you just watched, despite the perfect performances by the leads, most noticeably Blunt who even captures the famous monarch's expressions.<br/><br/>For as much as it tries, Victoria succeeds on many levels but lacks that certain sparkle that would take it from solid to classic.\"}, {'username': '3xHCCH', 'rating': '6', 'helpful': '3', 'total': '6', 'date': '19 October 2009', 'title': ' Beautiful Film, but Could Have Spent More Time to Flesh Out the Characters\\n', 'review': 'As I had always written in previous reviews, I am very fond of watching historical films. When I saw this on the list of Qantas flight home from Sydney yesterday, this was the very first one I watched.<br/><br/>This film tells the story of Victoria from the days prior to and during the early days of her being a queen. Apart from the political intrigues surrounding her ascendancy to the throne, the film also shows us her love story with Prince Albert. As the film covered a lot of time, I felt that the story-telling was rushed through. You just get the main story, but not enough development of characters and exposition of their motivations.<br/><br/>Some characters are clearly villainous like Victoria\\'s mother, the Duchess of Kent (Miranda Richardson), and her nasty adviser Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong). However, the character of Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany) was of nebulous motivations. The character of King William was very well played by the unrecognizable Jim Broadbent, but I had never actually seen a king address his enemy so scandalously on a banquet table! As expected, there was beautiful cinematography, as well as very colorful period costumes and elaborate set designs. The acting of Emily Blunt (whom I only knew from \"The Devil Wears Prada\")as the young Victoria and of Rupert Friend (whom I never saw before) as her consort are very lively and strong. Their scenes together were the best parts of the movie. But again, the hastily edited final sequences and the abrupt ending left me unsatisfied. I was expecting more.

Where would a costume drama be without the flamboyant dresses, beautiful countryside or the complicated dances? The ingredients were all present but that does not mean to say that they were there in the right quantity, mixed together correctly or were cooked at the right temperature. What this ridiculous metaphor is attempting to say is that although it had the makings of a great drama it did fall short.<br/><br/>As with all stories following the British monarchy we are treated to life at court, conspiracy and conniving but this all fell quite short of the mark. The viciousness or desperation that makes such good viewing just wasn't there. It felt as though it was all just mentioned in passing. The ever dependable Paul Bettany as Lord Melbourne and Mark Strong (who is everywhere these days) as Sir John Conroy were very watchable at trying to play the political game but to be honest very little happened.<br/><br/>The best scenes in the whole movie were those that focused on Victoria and Albert. Their game of chess was filled with tension and absorbing to watch. Although the movie was clearly about Victoria's younger years I think that it should have focused more on her life with Albert They had nine children together and lived happily together up until Albert's death. The fact that she lived for almost forty years without her sole mate is heartbreaking and this would have given some good strong emotional scenes but this opportunity was missed.<br/><br/>The music was actually very imposing and the coronation music actually sounded like the start of the Champions League coverage which was also very distracting It was a very enjoyable movie but it just lacked that defining moment where Victoria transformed from this sheltered teenager into a strong willed women who reined supreme. It gets a 7/10.\"}, {'username': 'Turfseer', 'rating': '8', 'helpful': '2', 'total': '4', 'date': '4 January 2010', 'title': ' Engaging drama and fascinating history lesson\\n', 'review': \"Who knew? Dowdy Queen Victoria, the plump Monarch who was a virtual recluse for 40 years after the death of her husband, Prince Albert, actually led a life fraught with drama and intrigue in her younger days. 'The Young Victoria' not only chronicles the young Queen's romance with her husband-to-be but also does a pretty good job of detailing the political machinations surrounding her ascent to the throne.<br/><br/>The Act I 'set-up' draws you in right away. Following the death of Victoria's father, the Duke of Kent in 1820, less than a year after Victoria's birth, the Duchess of Kent eventually hooked up with former Army Officer John Conroy, who offered his services as comptroller to the widow and her infant queen-to-be. Conroy insisted that Victoria be raised under the atrocious 'Kensington system', rules designed to prevent the future Queen from having any contact with other children while growing up. What's more, Victoria was forced to sleep in her mother's bedroom everyday until she became Queen.<br/><br/>The film explains that in 1830 Parliament passed the Regency Act, which established that Victoria's mother would become regent (and hence Guardian) in the event that Victoria acceded to the throne while still a minor. During this time, the Duchess and Conroy tried to intimidate the hapless princess and insisted that she sign papers making Conroy her private secretary and treasurer. Strong-willed Victoria would have none of it, and refused to go along with Conroy's and her mother's nefarious plans. The Duchess disliked King William as she regarded him as a philanderer who brought disrespect to the Monarchy; the King felt the Duchess disrespected his wife. As a result, the Duchess attempted to limit Victoria's contact with the King. In an over-the-top scene which seemed to actually have occurred in history, the King berated the Duchess at his birthday banquet, stating that it was his goal to survive until Victoria reached her 18th birthday so that her mother would not become regent.<br/><br/>King William kept his word and died a short time after Victoria became eligible to accede to the throne. Victoria took revenge on her mother for her support of Conroy, whom she blamed for making her childhood so miserable. They were both banished to a secluded apartment in Buckingham Palace and for a number of years Victoria had little contact with her mother.<br/><br/>'The Young Victoria' conveys the excitement and pomp and circumstance surrounding Victoria's coronation as Queen. A good part of the film deals with Victoria's relationship with Lord Melbourne, the Whig Party Prime Minister who unfortunately is depicted in the film as much younger than he actually was. In the beginning Melbourne gains the young Queen's trust and they become good friends. In the early years of her reign, she sees Melbourne as a progressive, but later loses respect for him somewhat as he's revealed to be a typical politician, hiding his contempt for the masses whom he's supposed to be championing. In reality, Melbourne was more a father figure to Victoria, but the film hints at some sexual tension between the Prime Minister and Prince Albert, as though they were romantic rivals.<br/><br/>The plot thickens when Melbourne is forced out and the Queen must commission Sir Robert Peel, of the more conservative Tory party, as the new Prime Minister. The film chronicles the events of 'The Bedchamber Crisis' in which Peel resigned after Victoria refused to replace some of her Bedchamber ladies with the wives of Tory politicians. The film leaves out another scandal which involved a Lady Hastings, one of the Duchess's ladies-in-waiting who was accused of having an affair with John Conroy and becoming pregnant by him. Because of her hatred for Conroy, Victoria contributed to the nasty rumors being spread about Hastings' alleged pregnancy. As it turned out, Hastings only appeared pregnant—what she actually had was an abdominal tumor. Victoria's inexperience shows during the Bedchamber Crisis but the film's scenarists ignore some of the more unsavory aspects of her character as evidenced by the Hastings Affair.<br/><br/>The rest of the 'The Young Victoria' deals with -- of course -- the romance between the Queen and Prince Albert. Victoria kept Albert waiting, as the film makes clear, since she wanted to acclimate herself to her duties as the new Sovereign. They spent a good deal of time corresponding with one another until Albert returned to England and gave Victoria support during the trying times of the Bedchamber Crisis.<br/><br/>I find a good number of parallels between Prince Albert and Prince Philip, the current Queen's husband. While Philip is mainly Danish, he went to school in Germany and had in-laws who were of German background. Both Albert and Philip made it their business to reform etiquette in the Court (there's a great scene where Albert discovers that the servants are still setting a table for King George III even though he had been dead for years!). Albert's struggle was the same for Philip—as husbands of Monarchs, they had to find something to do. Both Albert and Philip became involved in various civic projects and proved that they didn't have to live continually in the shadow of their ever-popular wives.<br/><br/>Fortunately there's an excellent scene toward the end of the film where Albert infuriates Victoria with what she perceives as his 'interference' in her affairs. Albert doesn't want a second 'Bedchamber Crisis' so he goes over his wife's head and arranges a compromise involving Victoria's bedchamber ladies. Victoria is barely talking to Albert when an assassin's bullets almost cuts them both down (in the film Albert is shot in the arm but this never happened!).<br/><br/>The performances in the film are uniformly excellent, especially the principals, Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend. The Young Victoria ends rather abruptly and the closing credits lean too much toward hagiography (no mention of Victoria's depression after Albert's death). But 'Victoria' is still an engaging drama and fascinating history lesson.\"}, {'username': 'druid333-2', 'rating': '10', 'helpful': '2', 'total': '4', 'date': '3 January 2010', 'title': ' Like The Moves On A Chessboard\\n', 'review': \"With all of the films of recent,dealing with the British Monarchy,is it really time for another?

Much of the early portion of the film, that part when Victoria is a child whose ascent to the throne is contested by her mother (Miranda Richardson) and Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong) seems to drag and get lost in the multiple costumes and scenery variations. But once Victoria (Emily Blunt) comes of age and is courted by Prince Albert (Rupert Friend) the film blooms. Blunt is a strong actress and finds that delicate line between girlish infatuation and royal dignity that makes her a fine foil for those at court who would seek to control the 'child queen' - including her secretary Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany). But as she matures into her role as queen her eye dwells on the dashing German Prince Albert, and a love affair that has lasted in the memories of everyone is matched by the concept of joining Royalty with concern for the care of her subjects - much due to the sensitivity of Albert. The film takes us to the birth of their first of nine children and then ends with some statements about the influence of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert's effect on the various Royalties throughout Europe!

It was a challenge for Emily Blunt, still only in her mid twenties, to carry a major movie in this way but she gives a fine performance, by turns vulnerable, assertive, impetuous, and amorous.<br/><br/>Diana, Princess of Wales, famously asserted that there were always three people in her marriage to Prince Charles and her royal predecessor Victoria - albeit in a different sense - had many people in her courtship with and marriage to her first cousin, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (Rupert Friend), most notably Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany), and this account makes plain the personal and political manoeuvring around the teenager as she sought her independence.<br/><br/>It is a fascinating history tale by French-Canadian director Jean-Marc Vallée but, as a film, fails to excite or engage, since the script by Julian Fellowes does not come up to the standards of his work for \"Gosford Park\".

Queen Victoria showed all her naysayers and her country that she was a powerful and endearing leader. The first years of her rule are chronicled in the period movie \"The Young Victoria\". Emily Blunt stars as the titled character, and she continues to prove most worthy of her acting range and that she thespian rules! Director Jean Marc Valee\\' assembles the movie more as a love story than a power monarchy struggle. In other words, Valee\\' parks the narrative mostly as Victoria\\'s relationship with Prince Albert. But nevertheless, \"The Young Victoria\" still has plenty of the formulaic reign jealousy that is incorporated in most period movies. So I am sorry Jean Marc, but maybe you should Valee\\' your period movie creativity in unchartered historical waters. In other words, develop something that has not been included in this genre for your next period flick. The \"Young Victoria\" is based on a true story and you cannot defy history but you can spice it up with a little novelty for viewer enchantment. Jean Marc, I would give the same advice to your fellow filmmaker Julian Fellowes, who scripted \"The Young Victoria\". Fellowes\\' past scripts have been a bit more jovial and less melancholy, so maybe its time for Julian to be once again a \"jolly good\" Fellowes in his screen writing contributions. Blunt was impressive but the rest of the cast was a bit too robotic for my taste; which included: Rupert Friend as Prince Albert, Miranda Richardson as the Duchess of Kent (Victoria\\'s mommy), and Paul Bettany as Lord Melbourne. Lord o lord, must these actors always use the same expression throughout the movie! I did enjoy the always charismatic Jim Broadbent as King William, but he was very much underutilized. I must coronate \"The Young Victoria\" with some positive feedback on its vibrant art direction and opulent costume design; but then again those are pretty much sure things when it comes to period flicks. \"The Young Victoria\" is what it is, not a victorious movie but a divine pleasure to history buffs and those who love a period love story (\"Carrie\" not included). *** Average'}, {'username': 'spxdes', 'rating': '6', 'helpful': '1', 'total': '2', 'date': '8 August 2010', 'title': ' England and history deserves better !\\n', 'review': 'This is a movie that deserves a better direction, specially a much better art direction.

It's so nice that everybody mostly gets along most of the time. Then, almost two hours later, it's over. It's a pretty and pleasantly acted movie. Not that it's boring per se. There are hints of conflict-- the lightly abusive step-father who wants to use the future queen's power for his own agenda (although it's never clear what his agenda is—maybe he's a real do-gooder), the mother who chooses her man above her daughter, the charming Prime Minister who has a reputation for manipulating women and is always hanging about (and what woman wouldn't want Paul Bettany in period costume always within view?), the odds and ends of royals from here and there who promote their own candidates for husband of the queen-to-be. Oh and there's that truly nasty business when the head of the other political party is rather put-out because the newly crowned monarch won't include any women from his team on her list of ladies-in-waiting. Zounds! From a feminist perspective, the queen, being a queen, is required to ask her chosen mate for his hand in marriage, instead of the other way around, which is a fun change. But who will she ask?!!!! Who will it be?!!! Who?!!!! <br/><br/>Well, duh.<br/><br/>The most unexpected nugget the film leaves viewers with is that at one point in time, the Queen after whom the Victorian era, with its prim furnishings and tightly-clenched sphincters was named, was a cute, fun girl who liked to dance and knew a good man when she saw one. She even seemed to like sex, albeit within a monogamous relationship.

She is able to portray Victoria, as an astute young woman who knows she needs support from some key players and must be able to stand up to those who might now have her best interests at hand.<br/><br/>Victoria must fend a barrage of intrusions on her way to the crown, and even when she takes command of her new position, she discovers the road to self sufficiency will depend on making some very important decisions and of course, the right support. Luckily for Victoria, there is Albert, a man who appears to like her and is her soul mate. There is amazing chemistry between the two performers, and there\\'s little doubt what the outcome will be, but there is the figure of Bettany\\'s Prime Minister, a man who provides Victoria with some wise support and is also fond of her.<br/><br/>Miranda Richardson and Mark Strong shine in supporting roles as two parties who might be of questionable character and exert a considerable amount of power in the upbringing of the young girl. Every one of the supporting characters could use a bit more of development, but what we can see in the screen might be enough to keep us focused on the central character and a superb performance by Blunt, an actress who has shown enough fire and passion in previous performances. In here, she is given the breakout role of her career, a real life historical figure, who broke the rules and managed to rule for a very long time. She shows the seeds of the strength and character the monarch might have needed in her later years. She also has a sweetness and innocence that became the foundation of her charitable work and future intervention in social changes.<br/><br/>\"The Young Victoria\" is not a royal epic portrayal of England\\'s ruling class. It is an intimate story of how human beings grow up and whatever special circumstances surround and shape them. In the end, the movie is a lovely entry in a year that has shown much emphasis on war and destruction.

Not only is the history correct, but the style is sumptuous and yet intimate. I was a fan of Emily Blunt's portrayal of Victoria and how she kept her spirit even though she was forced into a virtual exile while in her youth. Blunt depicts the charismatic and sometimes dogmatic manner that Vicotria became famous (perhaps infamous) for. The romantic elements of the movie are so genuine and tender that by the end of the movie you genuinely understand why Vicotria chose to live the rest of her days in mourning of Albert.<br/><br/>The technical aspects of the film are worthy of note as well.

Emily Blunt(The Devil Wears Prada) is the star of the film, bringing Victoria to life and with this movie she shows that she is a great actress and maybe picking a first Oscar nomination for her performance. Rupert Friend is almost bland as Prince Albert but he has great chemistry with Emily Blunt. Paul Bettany is also solid as Lord Melbourne although i expected more of him. Jim Broadbent and Miranda Richardson both have supporting roles but are forgettable.<br/><br/>To me the film feels like unfinished.

It makes you guess about what is real and what is not. It happens more than once that you have to wonder about what is the truth and who is lying.<br/><br/>Because you are just as clueless as the main character, Michelle, you really get to experience the same type of emotions and confusion as she is. This not only makes you feel closer to Michelle as a character, but also to the overall story.<br/><br/>They did, however, ruin this connection that they build over the course of the story by making this sloppy, rushed and just strange ending.
